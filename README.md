# Adaptation of knee prosthesis
The objective of this project is the research and the development of a knee prosthesis with a short printing time, expecting to reduce the material used. For this reason, it is important to develop intelligent prostheses to control the actuators and thus emulate the walk of a person.

For this, the design of a knee prosthesis and a total knee prosthesis was carried out using the 3D Slice software
and Blender, which provides an image of the elements in a stl image format for study and 3D printing, to
improve the knee prosthesis that already exist.
